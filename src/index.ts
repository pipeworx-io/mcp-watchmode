/**
 * Legal authority typing and the age-labelling contract.
 *
 * Phase 0 of docs/secondary-legal-sources-plan.md (fleet #1970). This is the
 * SHARED shape that 14 federal secondary-legal source packs key on, so it is
 * defined once here rather than retrofitted across 14 packs later.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. The product claim is that an agent asking a legal question
 * can rank what it gets back — controlling authority above the issuing agency's
 * own reading of its rule, that above a practitioner manual, that above a law
 * review article, that above a 1910 treatise. No free legal tool does this. The
 * ranking is only possible if every pack labels its documents with the same
 * vocabulary, which is what `AUTHORITY_TYPES` and `BINDING_STATUSES` are.
 *
 * THE TWO AXES ARE NOT THE SAME AXIS, and conflating them is the mistake this
 * file exists to prevent:
 *
 *   authority_type  — what KIND of instrument this is. A property of the
 *                     document. Stable forever. A repealed statute is still a
 *                     statute.
 *   binding_status  — what FORCE it carries. Changes over time (a rule is
 *                     proposed, then binding, then vacated) and is the axis
 *                     `superseded_by` hangs off.
 *
 * A single "authority level" field cannot express "an agency manual that its own
 * staff must follow but which binds no court", and that describes the IRM, the
 * Justice Manual, the MPEP and the TMEP — four of our fourteen sources. Hence
 * two fields.
 *
 * Vocabulary rationale, including everything deliberately EXCLUDED:
 * docs/secondary-legal-authority-vocabulary.md

 * view of federal appropriations law. Persuasive and followed in practice by
 * agency counsel; not binding on courts." That sentence is genuinely more useful
 * to a caller than any enum value, and it is also unrankable, unfilterable and

 *   prose only  — reads well and cannot be computed over. Ranking 14 sources by
 *                 authority is the product promise; it dies here.
 *
 * So `binding_status` is the controlled vocabulary (machine-readable, what

 * never parsed). A pack SHOULD set both. The enum is what ranks; the note is
 * what explains. Nothing ever infers one from the other — a note is not parsed

/**
 * Was this failure OUR OWN web service? — the other half of `internal-db-class.ts`.
 *
 * fleet #1089 pulled failures from our own Postgres out of `upstream_down` by
 * keying on the SQLSTATE inside PostgREST's four-key error envelope. That
 * covered the majority and structurally could not cover the rest: the rest
 * never reach Postgres, so they carry no SQLSTATE. What was left, measured over
 * the 24h to 2026-09-02T15:00Z (fleet #1096):
 *
 *     5  pipeworx-catalog  get_pack_tools     Pipeworx catalog error: 522 — error code: 522
 *     3  fleet             fleet_list_open …  upstream_down: Fleet task queue did not respond within 25s
 *
 * 521/522/523/526 are Cloudflare saying its edge could not reach an ORIGIN, and
 * in both of those rows the origin is ours — `gateway.pipeworx.io` for the
 * catalog pack (it self-fetches when the gateway hasn't injected a manifest),
 * our own Supabase for fleet. There is no third party anywhere in either call.
 * Same defect as #1089: our own outage filed under `upstream_down`, the one
 * class that means "the source is unreachable and there is nothing for us to
 * fix", which is why the problem-tools triage skips it.
 *
 * WHY NOT A WORDING RULE. The obvious fix is to match `fleet db error:` and
 * `Pipeworx catalog error:` in classifyToolError. Each is emitted from exactly
 * one site today, so it would work today. It would also rot the first time
 * somebody rewords a label — silently, and in the direction of hiding our own
 * outage, which is worse than the bug being fixed. Every prose rule in
 * error-class.ts has needed widening as packs invented new wording (#409/#450/
 * #584); that history is most of that file's comment budget.
 *
 * WHAT THIS KEYS ON INSTEAD: **the host the call actually reached.** A URL's
 * hostname is a fact about the call, not a guess about its prose. Two
 * consequences that a pack-level flag could not give us, and the reason the
 * flag was rejected:
 *
 *   - It describes the CALL, not the pack. `govcon-intel` fans out to our own
 *     Supabase AND to genuine third parties; `court-listener` holds our cache
 *     in Supabase and fetches courtlistener.com. An `internallyHosted: true` on
 *     either pack would relabel a real third-party outage as ours — inventing
 *     work, which is the same class of error in the opposite direction.
 *   - It covers every future internal pack for free, instead of one declared
 *     slug at a time.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVES A REWORD. The marker below is not matched as a literal by two
 * separate files. `markInternalOrigin()` writes it and `internalHostMetricsClass()`
 * reads it, both from the single exported `INTERNAL_ORIGIN_MARKER` constant in
 * this module — so changing the wording changes both sides in the same edit and
 * cannot desynchronise them. The pack's own label (`fleet db error:`,
 * `Pipeworx catalog error:`) is not read at all: reword it freely, the class is
 * unaffected. That is the property `stripClassPrefix` lacked when it drifted
 * from its own classifier three times and needed a CI gate to hold them
 * together.
 *
 * WHERE THE 5xx TEST LIVES. `markInternalOrigin` is called from the places that
 * hold the real `Response` — `httpError`/`httpErrorMessage` and the timeout
 * branch of `fetchWithTimeout` in `shared/src/http.ts` — so "is this an
 * availability failure" is decided from the actual status code, never re-derived
 * by scraping a number out of a sentence. A 404 from our own registry for a slug
 * that does not exist is a caller's bad argument and is deliberately NOT marked.
 */

/**
 * OUR OWN web service was unreachable — not an upstream, and never `upstream_down`.
 *
 * ONE value, not three, unlike `internal_db_*`. That split existed because a
 * slow query, an exhausted pool and an unknown SQLSTATE have different owners
 * and different fixes. Here there is only one story to tell — an origin we run
 * did not answer the edge — and one owner. A bucket with no distinct owner per
 * value is decoration; #724 is what happens when a class holds several
 * situations, and inventing sub-values ahead of a reason to act on them
 * differently is the same mistake with the sign flipped.
 *
 * METRICS ONLY, exactly like PLATFORM_KEY_ERROR_CLASS and the internal_db
 * values. `classifyToolError` still answers `upstream_down` for the retry and
 * hint paths, which only care whether retrying or a sibling tool might work —
 * and it might. Nothing a caller sees or is charged changes here.
 *
 * READ SIDE: this value is in BROKEN_TOOL_CLASSES, FAULT_CLASSES and
 * ALL_ERROR_CLASSES in `workers/registry-api/src/index.ts`. All three, or it

 * and the fleet pack rebuilds its error from a captured status + body across a
 * retry loop. A property on an Error would be dropped by every one of those
 * paths and the class would work in tests and vanish in production.

  // `languages` was removed 2026-08-09 (fleet #183): it called GET /languages/,
  // which 400s "Invalid method" on every call — not an auth problem (an invalid
  // key gets a distinct "Please enter a valid API key" error; a valid key on a
  // wrong path gets this one). Confirmed against Watchmode's own OpenAPI spec
  // (api.watchmode.com/openapi.json): there is no /languages path anywhere in
  // the documented surface, alongside /status /sources /regions /networks
  // /genres /search /autocomplete-search /list-titles /title/* /person/*
  // /releases /title-release-dates /changes/*. It organizes by country/region,
  // not language, so there is no keyless substitute to swap in — 0/10 calls
  // in 7 days succeeded because the endpoint never existed. Deleted rather
  // than left 400ing, so the router cannot pick it (same call as the dead
  // dwds `lemma` and rxnorm_interactions tools).
